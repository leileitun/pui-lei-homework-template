        The Reading Nook started from a class project, but grew into a personal passion project. 
        I found myself in a reading slump when starting this website, and The Reading Nook became a reason for me to read more and be proud of my growing collection. 

        Before reading or doing any sort of activity (chores, work, etc) I have the habit of playing Youtube video backdrops with some fun tunes. I find that setting the right visual backdrop and audio can enhance any activity. 

        With Reading Nook, you have a dedicated space to not only enjoy your book but also to store your collection. All in one place.
