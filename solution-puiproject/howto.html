        <p>Here's what you can do with us: 
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Immerse yourself in reading
        <br> 
        With our selection of lo-fi tunes and video backdrops, you can create the perfect reading ambiance for yourself. The sound of light rain drops, the hum of a distant train... everything is right at your reach. 
        <br> 
        <br>   
        2. Expand your bookshelf 
        <br> Unsatisfied with Goodreads? iBooks? Here at The Reading Nook, we keep things simple and effective. Upload your collection, write a review, and thatâ€™s it. No adding friends, being overwhelmed by book advertisements. We just care about YOUR journey.
        <br>   
        <br>
        3. Keep private things private
        <br> Your reading choices are yours. Reading is an intimate experience. This is why book covers are carefully chosen, protecting authors and book covers. How you choose to title each book is your choice. 
        <br> 
        <br>  
        4. Have fun!
